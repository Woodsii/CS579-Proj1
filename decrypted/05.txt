herodotus describes several clever ways people hid messages when danger made open communication impossible. he tells of histiaeus shaving a slave’s head, tattooing a warning on the bare skin, then waiting for the hair to grow back before sending him off. he also recounts how secret notes were written on wooden tablets and then covered with wax so they looked blank. through these stories, he shows how patience, subtlety, and ingenuity shaped ancient covert communication.
