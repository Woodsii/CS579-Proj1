george washington's cat, a bold little tabby named whisker, slipped out of the camp one foggy dawn. soldiers were still waking when the cat darted into the woods, chasing a drifting feather.

he wandered past tall pines until he reached a quiet creek. there he spotted a lost messenger horse grazing alone. whisker circled it, meowing loudly until the camp scouts heard the noise.

thanks to the cat's curious adventure, the horse and its important dispatch made it safely back to washington's tent. whisker returned too, proud and purring.
